# gammenion.github.io
This is the result of the *Hugo* static HTML generator for the blog. The original repo with all sources is [gammenion.github.io.src](https://github.com/gammenion/gammenion.github.io.src).  
  
The / location contains the English version of the blog. The /br location contains the Portugese version. This is achieved by having different config files in Hugo. The content is exactly the same but in different languages. This also means that the user can choose between two RSS feeds:
* One in /index.xml to receive content in English
* Another in /br/index.xml to receive it in Portuguese
